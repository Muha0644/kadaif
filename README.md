# Kadaif - HoI4 Modding Tool
**Kadaif** is a cross-platform tool meant to help you make mods for Hearts of Iron IV. With VSCode and all it's extensions, managing a massive codebase is easy, but it would be a lot easier if the code was well written to begin with.<br>
Most HoI 4 modders are not expert developers, so obvisouly the code they write will not be perfect (pretty shit in other words). That's where kadaif comes in!<br>
<br>
Kadaif aims to automate most boring things like making events, focuses, and gfx files. You can simply use the GUI and then generate everything. You don't even have to copy and paste, you can just specify the file you want to use and it will even detect existing stuff so you can edit it. When you combine this with VSC and it's extensions, your mod will have better performance and the code will look neater. 

### Kadaif has cool features such as:
* automatic code generation
* your mom
* convert all `.dds` files to BC3/DTX5 (to save space)
<br><br>

# Installation
Download a binary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Muha0644/kadaif/releases), or compile from source if you want the latest and greatest. If you use a Mac... I'm really sorry for you. Here, have a cookie üç™<br>
Anyway here is how to compile from source if you want to:<br>
* `git clone https://github.com/Muha0644/kadaif`
* `cd kadaif`
* `make`

Of course if you use Arch Linux there is an AUR package: `kadaif-git` or `kadaif-bin` (not yet, this text is a placeholder)

# Sponsored section
This section is an advertisement for a mod i'm working on. Check out **Waves of the Danube (WotD)** - A TNO submod that aims to add content for Hungary, Croatia, Romania, and eventually the rest of the Balkans.

Naturally, if you want Waves of the Danube to come out sooner. A larger team would be needed. If you have good GFX skills, writing skills or god bless us, have coding knowledge in HOI4 (or C++). Please join [our discord](https://discord.gg/kXsaS6jzsH)!<br><br>
